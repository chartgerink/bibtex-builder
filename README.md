# bibtex-builder
Masterfully build BibTex databases for everyone!

In short:
- A bash shell script that creates or appends a BibTex Database based on a Doi key

## Why the bibtex-builder?
Also hate spending time on making BibTex-databases and think current BibTex creaters are lacking?
We present a command line alternative:
- Automatically create a full BibTex-Database using only the doi key
- Run: ```bibtex-database.sh yourBibDatabase.bib``` 
- Supply a doi key (e.g. 10.1002/scin.5591780519) and done!
- or run: ```cat fileWithMultipleDoiKeys.txt | bibtex-database.sh``` 

doi keys of existing literature can be easily found at https://search.crossref.org/
